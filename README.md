### Colours Theme

The BKK Coffee Corner page is a user-friendly website and it's about coffee! so the main colours I chose are brown and beige, warm and invited tones. I used Maroon color for buttons to make it outstanding. Moreover, I used [WebAIM:Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/) to check the contrast of my colours to ensure they are easy to read for users.

### Typography

I used [League Spartan](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) pairing with [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) because Lora contrasts nicely with the bold, modern look of Spartan. The elegant and traditional feel complements strong contemporary aesthetic combination two fonts creates visually appealing harmonious design.

Additionally, I use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons to make the site casual and friendly and for my social media icons in the footer to help users quickly and easily identify my social media sites.
