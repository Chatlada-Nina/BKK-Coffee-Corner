## UX

### User‚Äôs Goal

Users want to discover new coffee shops and cafes in their local area, read reviews, find opening hours, and explore what each venue has to offer. They seek a platform that provides detailed information, user-generated content, and an easy way to plan visits.

### Owner‚Äôs Goal

The site owner aims to build a comprehensive list of local coffee shops and cafes, attracting coffee enthusiasts who frequently visit the site. By providing this service, the owner can gather valuable data on coffee shop trends, promote their own favorite cafes, and potentially monetize through partnerships, sponsored listings, or advertisements.

### Colours Theme

The BKK Coffee Corner page is a user-friendly website and it's about coffee! so the main colours I chose are brown and beige, warm and invited tones. I used Maroon color for buttons to make it outstanding. Moreover, I used [WebAIM:Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/) to check the contrast of my colours to ensure they are easy to read for users.

![The colour theme of the website](/documentation/readme/color-theme.png)

### Typography

I used [League Spartan](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) pairing with [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) because Lora contrasts nicely with the bold, modern look of Spartan. The elegant and traditional feel complements strong contemporary aesthetic combination two fonts creates visually appealing harmonious design.

Additionally, I use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons to make the site casual and friendly and for my social media icons in the footer to help users quickly and easily identify my social media sites.

### Features left to implement

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

### Deployment and Local Deployment

### Deployment

The Live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://bkk-coffee-corner-f07d5b0b8233.herokuapp.com/).

### Database

This project uses [Neon.tech](https://www.neon.tech) for the PostgreSQL Database. This was provided by Code Institute via a database-maker website for Code Institute Students.

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the Cloudinary API to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.<br>
On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your API Environment Variable.<br>
Be sure to remove the CLOUDINARY_URL= as part of the API value; this is the key.

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.
For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the _requirements.txt_ file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `‚åò+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

#### Forking repo on GitHub

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

#### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

### Heroku Deployment

The application was deployed to Heroku. In order to deploy, the following steps were taken:

1. If you have an account, login to Heroku. Otherwise create a new account.
2. Once signed in, click the "New" button in the top right corner, below the header and choose "Create new app".
3. Choose a unique name for the application and select your region. When done, click "Create app".
4. This brings you to the "Deploy" tab. From here, click the "Settings" tab and scroll down to the "Config Vars" section and click on "Reveal Config Vars" and set your environment variables.

| Key                     | Value                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL`        | user's own value                                                     |
| `DATABASE_URL`          | user's own value                                                     |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (_this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment_) |
| `SECRET_KEY`            | user's own value                                                     |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy:

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- _replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located_

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace _app_name_ with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
  - `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!
