## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| Home             | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/w3c-html/homepage.png)                   | 1.) The error is because the width attribute of the <img> tag expects a value in pixels not a percentage. To fix this, I used CSS to set the width as a percentage instead. 2.) The trailing slash on void elements has no effect and interacts badly with unquoted attribute values. In HTML5, void elements should not have a trailing slash. To fix this, I have removed the trailing slash and made sure that attribute values are quoted. |

The error is because the width attribute of the <img> tag expects a value in pixels not a percentage. To fix this, I used CSS to set the width as a percentage instead. 2.) The Error: Stray end tag div. I fixed this issue by rearranging the div tag on the forum_list.html to make sure the end tag did not stray from the open tag.                                                                                                   |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS file.

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files (the comments.js file, the reviews.js file and the forums.js file). After inserting /_jshint esversion: 6 _/ at the top of the files no errors were returned apart from one undefined variable - bootstrap.

| File        | Screenshot                                                  | Notes                                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| comments.js | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/jshint/comments-js.png) | One undefined variable "bootstrap" see below. |
| reviews.js  | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/jshint/reviews-js.png)  | One undefined variable "bootstrap" see below. |
| forums.js   | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/jshint/forums-js.png)   | One undefined variable "bootstrap" see below. |

One undefined variable "bootstrap".

This appears when using Bootstrap's JavaScript components because JSHint doesn't recognize the bootstrap object as a global variable, even though it is defined globally by the included Bootstrap JS file.
This is a common issue with external libraries that define global variables. JSHint doesn't automatically detect these variables unless they are declared in the configuration.

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files. No errors were returned:

### Responsiveness

- The website has been tested on different devices(under which; iPhone 13 / Samsung Galaxy S9 / MacBook Air / Lenovo laptop).
- The website was responsive on all screens from mobile phones to desktops.
- Chrome DEV Tools have been used to check the responsivness throughout the development of the website.

### Lighthouse

I've audited my deployed project with the Lighthouse tool to identify any significant issues. Overall, I'm pleased with the results. However, it's worth noting that the 'Best Practices' score is notably affected by the Cloudinary images.
